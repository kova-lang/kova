# Kova Programming Language

Kova is a lightweight, expressive, and modern programming language designed for clarity, speed, and extensibility. Inspired by simplicity-first principles, Kova introduces a clean syntax, web-native primitives, and a predictable execution model that makes it easy for developers to write safe and fast code.

---

##  Overview

Kova is engineered for:

* **Readable, minimal syntax**
* **Built‑in HTTP verbs as keywords** (`POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`)
* **Database-like keywords** (`save`, `into`)
* **Zero‑surprise semantics**
* **Compiler-only: Kova compiles to JavaScript (Node.js).**
* **Easy integration with JavaScript environments**

---

##  Features

### ENV Support

Kova supports environment variables via `ENV.KEY`, allowing secure access to configuration values.

### Imports

Kova supports importing modules using `import` statements for modular code.

### 1. Clean Syntax

Kova uses English‑like expressions that reduce boilerplate:

```kova
POST "/user" save userData into database
```

### 2. First-Class HTTP Verbs

HTTP requests are native operations. Example:

```kova
GET "https://api.example.com/data" into result
```

### 3. Simple Data Flow

Kova encourages explicit value flow:

```kova
let x = 20
let y = x * 2
```

### 4. Custom VM & Lexer

Kova ships with:

* Tokenizer (lexer)
* Parser (AST generator)
* Interpreter/VM

Written in **JavaScript**.

##  Project Structure

##  Environment Variables

Kova can read `.env` files and access variables using the `ENV.KEY` syntax.

Example:

```
CONNECT mysql USING {
    host: ENV.DB_HOST,
    user: ENV.DB_USER,
    password: ENV.DB_PASS,
    database: ENV.DB_NAME
}
```

##  Imports

Kova supports importing modules using:

```
import utils from "./utils.kova"
import { encrypt } from "security"
```

### Updated Lexer

The lexer recognizes:

* `ENV`
* `import`
* `{` and `}` for object literals
* `.` for ENV access
* identifiers for module names

Below is the lexer responsibility summary:

* tokenize `ENV.KEY`
* tokenize import statements
* tokenize database keywords and operators

A typical Kova compiler/interpreter project:

```
kova/
 ├── src/
 │    ├── lexer.js
 │    ├── parser.js
 │    ├── ast.js
 │    ├── interpreter.js
 │    └── tokens.js
 ├── examples/
 │    └── demo.kova
 ├── docs/
 │    └── language-spec.md
 └── README.md
```

##  Core Concepts

###  Tokens

The Kova lexer recognizes:

* identifiers
* numbers
* strings
* operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `==`, `!=`, `=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)
* boolean literals: `true`, `false`
* keywords: `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `save`, `into`, `let`, `if`, `else`, `CONNECT`, `USING`, `import`, `from`, `ENV`

###  AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)

Readable structure representing code before execution.

###  Compiler-first runtime model

Kova v1 is a compiler-first language: source `.kova` files are compiled into idiomatic JavaScript (Express.js) and executed by Node.js. There is no built-in VM or interpreter executing Kova bytecode in v1. Future releases may introduce an optional VM or interpreter.

###  Database Driver Plugin Architecture

Kova supports a driver/plugin model for databases. The compiler emits abstract calls to a driver loader which selects the correct adapter for the requested engine (for example: `postgres`, `cockroach`, `mysql`, `sqlite`, `mongodb`, `redis`).

* Syntax example:

```
CONNECT db USING "postgres"
```

* The compiler will generate code that calls a driver loader (for example `loadDriver('postgres', config)`), and driver modules implement `save`, `query`, `connect`, `disconnect` operations used by generated code.
* This plugin model keeps the compiler small and extensible: new drivers are added as separate adapter modules without changing the core compiler.

###  ENV access

Use `ENV.KEY` in Kova to reference environment variables. The compiler injects `dotenv.config()` when ENV usage is detected and emits `process.env.KEY` in generated JS.

##  Example Program

```kova
let name = "Kova"
let age = 2 * 10

if age == 20 {
  POST "/log" save name into server
}
```
