# Kova Programming Language

Kova is a lightweight, expressive, and modern programming language designed for clarity, speed, and extensibility. Inspired by simplicity-first principles, Kova introduces a clean syntax, web-native primitives, and a predictable execution model that makes it easy for developers to write safe and fast code.

---

##  Overview

Kova is engineered for:

* **Readable, minimal syntax**
* **Built‑in HTTP verbs as keywords** (`POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`)
* **Database-like keywords** (`save`, `into`)
* **Zero‑surprise semantics**
* **Small, embeddable interpreter/VM**
* **Easy integration with JavaScript environments**

---

##  Features

### 1. Clean Syntax

Kova uses English‑like expressions that reduce boilerplate:

```kova
POST "/user" save userData into database
```

### 2. First-Class HTTP Verbs

HTTP requests are native operations. Example:

```kova
GET "https://api.example.com/data" into result
```

### 3. Simple Data Flow

Kova encourages explicit value flow:

```kova
let x = 20
let y = x * 2
```

### 4. Custom VM & Lexer

Kova ships with:

* Tokenizer (lexer)
* Parser (AST generator)
* Interpreter/VM

Written in **JavaScript**.

##  Project Structure

A typical Kova compiler/interpreter project:

```
kova/
 ├── src/
 │    ├── lexer.js
 │    ├── parser.js
 │    ├── ast.js
 │    ├── interpreter.js
 │    └── tokens.js
 ├── examples/
 │    └── demo.kova
 ├── docs/
 │    └── language-spec.md
 └── README.md
```

---

##  Core Concepts

### ✔ Tokens

The Kova lexer recognizes:

* identifiers
* numbers
* strings
* operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `==`, `!=`, `=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)
* boolean literals: `true`, `false`
* keywords: `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `save`, `into`, `let`, `if`, `else`

### ✔ AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)

Readable structure representing code before execution.

### ✔ Interpreter

Executes AST nodes with predictable evaluation rules.

## 📝 Example Program

```kova
let name = "Kova"
let age = 2 * 10

if age == 20 {
  POST "/log" save name into server
}
```

---

## 🔧 Building From Source

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Run the interpreter:

```
node src/interpreter.js examples/demo.kova
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

```
npm test
```
